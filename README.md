The migrations are somewhat working, tho a lot of the setup code is redundant, and I set most of them to not delete on cascade!
TODO: Make someone look into this cuz i'm too tired.
Atleast it works to create the database..
TODO: Seed the database

PS: The structure below changed a lot, so take a look in the models from Class Library (Shared) or make a diagram for the database.

To apply migrations: `dotnet ef database update` (assuming you have the necessary dependencies installed)

DATABASE STRUCTURE: (look into models)
